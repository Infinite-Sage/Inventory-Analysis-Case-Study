# Retail Inventory Analysis Dashboard in Tableau

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail company's inventory dataset across different product categories and countries using Tableau dashboards.
The objective is to optimize inventory management, identify top-performing product classes, and guide future purchasing strategies.

The dataset is fictional but simulates a real-world retail inventory scenario.

### Business Objective

  1. Identify top-performing products (Class A, B, and C) using ABC analysis.

  2. Analyze inventory turnover to evaluate stocking efficiency.

  3. Highlight category and country-level sales patterns for better stock allocation.

  4. Recommend actions to optimize procurement and reduce excess inventory.

Tools Used

  - Tableau

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - Inventory Turnover Calculation

  - ABC Classification

  - Dashboard Development and Storytelling


### Key Insights

   1. Inventory Turnover:
      High-value (Class A) products have higher turnover rates, suggesting efficient stock movement.
      However, some Class B products have turnover rates close to Class A, indicating opportunities to restock and promote them.
    ‚Üí Recommendation: Increase Class B inventory stock levels for potential revenue growth.

   2. Revenue Concentration:
      Class A products contributed the majority of 2021 revenue (over 300K USD), heavily outperforming Class B and C items.

   3. Category Breakdown:

     -  Home Accessories and Decoration dominate revenue generation.

     -  Office & School category shows high inventory turnover but low revenue ‚Äî needs pricing or marketing review.

   4. Home Accessories and Decoration drove the majority of revenue but showed moderate turnover rates, suggesting a need to review inventory levels carefully.

   5. Country Breakdown:
      Orders mainly come from the USA, Canada, and several European countries, suggesting priority regions for inventory focus.
    ‚Üí Recommendation: Prioritize stocking strategies aligned with these key markets.

   6. COGS & Inventory Stock Changes:
      Inventory sales shifted slightly from Home Accessories to Toys & Edibles between 2020 and 2021.
      Jewelry shows the least stock movement and may require reassessment.
      
   7. Revenue Year-over-Year Comparison:
      Certain products (like Doughnut Lip Gloss and Grow a Flytrap Kit) showed strong YoY revenue gains and should be prioritized.
      Product-Level Analysis showed that top sellers like "Doughnut Lip Gloss" almost doubled their revenue share from 2020 to 2021, indicating strong market trends.

### Final Recommendation

Through this analysis, procurement and inventory teams can make smarter decisions:

    Scale stock for fast-moving Class B products.

    Focus purchases on high-turnover categories like Office & School.

    Monitor underperforming categories (e.g., Jewelry) for potential de-prioritization.

    Align purchasing strategy geographically toward high-demand countries like the USA and European regions.
