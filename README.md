# Retail Inventory Analysis with Tableau

### Project Overview

This project analyzes a retail inventory dataset covering sales and stock movements from 2020 to 2022.
Using Tableau, I performed a full exploratory analysis and developed interactive dashboards to help optimize inventory purchasing decisions, reduce dead stock, and improve category-level performance.

The analysis focuses on revenue generation by product class (ABC analysis), inventory turnover efficiency, country-level order distribution, and category performance.

### Business Objective

  1. Identify top-performing products (Class A, B, and C) using ABC analysis.

  2. Analyze inventory turnover to evaluate stocking efficiency.

  3. Highlight category and country-level sales patterns for better stock allocation.

  4. Recommend actions to optimize procurement and reduce excess inventory.

Tools Used

  - Tableau

  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

  - Inventory Turnover Calculation

  - ABC Classification

  - Dashboard Development and Storytelling


### Key Insights

   1. Class A items contributed over 70% of total revenue, but Class B items showed similar turnover efficiency.
    → Recommendation: Increase Class B inventory stock levels for potential revenue growth.

   2. Office & School category had strong turnover but underperformed in stock allocation.
    → Recommendation: Adjust purchasing strategy to capitalize on faster-moving categories.

   3. Home Accessories and Decoration drove the majority of revenue but showed moderate turnover rates, suggesting a need to review inventory levels carefully.

   4. USA and Europe were the dominant regions for order volumes.
    → Recommendation: Prioritize stocking strategies aligned with these key markets.

   5. Product-Level Analysis showed that top sellers like "Doughnut Lip Gloss" almost doubled their revenue share from 2020 to 2021, indicating strong market trends.

### Final Recommendation

Through this analysis, procurement and inventory teams can make smarter decisions:

    Scale stock for fast-moving Class B products.

    Focus purchases on high-turnover categories like Office & School.

    Monitor underperforming categories (e.g., Jewelry) for potential de-prioritization.

    Align purchasing strategy geographically toward high-demand countries like the USA and European regions.
